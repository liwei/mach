The code is this directory compiles and runs on a Mach 3.0 system.
The code in the Mach2.5 directory works on a Mach 2.5 system.

The program built from master.c can be named master, slave or stats.
The master and slave programs can be on the same or different hosts.
The program finds the netmemory_sever by the name "netmemoryserver"
unless the environment variable NETMEMORYSERVER_NAME is defined, 
in which case it uses the value of that variable.

The master program is called as follows:
	master [spin | check | read | write | null] size(KB)

Master creates an memory object that is
backed by the netmemory server and registers this object so that
the slave program can find it. It maps the object into its memory
and then performs the operation that was requested. Only one operation
can be requested at a time. size (input in KB) is the number of words
that are touched.

The slave program is called as follows:
	slave [spin | check | read | write | null] host size(KB)

Slave looks up the shared memory object on the host specified by the
hostname argument. This should be the host  that the master program
is running on. It maps the object into its address
space and then proceeds to perform whatever operation was requested.


spin - causes the program to allow a context switch for each page
	that would be touched in size number of words.

check - master sets each word in shared object to i % 113
	slave checks that each word in the shared object is = i % 113

read - reads words from the shared object

write - writes words to the shared object

null - touchs size number of words not on the mapped object.

The total ammont of time used for these operations is printed out
in all cases.

Stats is called
	stats host

it will call the  netmemory_statisitics primitive on the host given.
