Mach4 / LITES

Your best bet for getting a Mach 3.0/Unix system running on NetBSD for
FreeBSD or Linux is to pick up the current Mach4 kernel from Utah and
the LITES server from Helsinki.  For more information:

Mach4:	http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flexmach/mach4/html/Mach4-proj.html
LITES:	http://www.cs.hut.fi/lites.html

However, the OSF/1 microkernel is coming.  Watch this space for more
details.
